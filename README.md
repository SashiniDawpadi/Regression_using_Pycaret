## Introduction
In this notebook, you will learn how to use PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python, to build and evaluate regression models efficiently. The tutorial covers various techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, ensembling, stacking, and blending.

## Setup
To run this notebook, you donâ€™t need to install anything locally. You can open and execute the notebook directly in Google Colab, which provides a cloud-based environment with all the necessary dependencies pre-installed.

## Running on Google Colab
Follow these steps to run the notebook on Google Colab:

1. **Open the Notebook on GitHub**:
   - Navigate to the notebook file (`Regression_using_Pycaret.ipynb`) on the GitHub repository.

2. **Open with Colab**:
   - Once you are viewing the notebook file on GitHub, you will see a `Open in Colab` button if available, or you can manually open it in Colab by replacing `github.com` in the URL with `colab.research.google.com/github/`. For example:
   
     ```
     https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/your-repo-name/blob/main/Regression_using_Pycaret.ipynb
     ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - After the notebook opens in Colab, you can run each cell sequentially by clicking on the play button next to each code cell.

4. **Save Your Work** (Optional):
   - If you want to save your work, you can either save a copy to your Google Drive by selecting `File > Save a copy in Drive`, or you can download the notebook by selecting `File > Download .ipynb`.
